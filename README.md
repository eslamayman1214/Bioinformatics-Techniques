# Bioinformatics-Techniques

### They are different types of biological algorithms for DNA & RNA sequences and Proteins.
* BLAST PROJECT :
In bioinformatics, BLAST is an algorithm and program for comparing primary biological sequence information, such as the amino-acid sequences of proteins or the nucleotides of DNA and/or RNA sequences.
INPUT :
1- A protein sequence query
2- Word threshold
3- Word length
4- HSP threshold
OUTPUT :
1- HSP(s) with their score if they exist. Along with the ID of the sequence in the database that the
hsp was found in (For example, the first sequence would have ID of zero, the second sequence
would have ID of 1…etc)
2- If not, then output a message indicating that the query wasn’t found.

* LOCAL ALIGNMENT TASK :
a python code to perform local alignment on two DNA or Protein Sequance.

* GLOBAL ALIGNMENT TASK :
a python code to perform global alignment on two DNA or Protein Sequance.

* MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT :
a python code to the progressive multiple sequences alignment technique to align multiple Protein Sequances/DNA sequences together.

* PHYLOGENETIC TREE TASK :
a python code to construct a phylogenetic tree given an input distance matrix using the UPGMA method.
